/**
 * How a loopback entrypoint finds the client that granted a stub.
 *
 * A loopback runs in the loader Worker, in its own I/O context, with nothing
 * but `ctx.props` to go on. The props name a host and a hosted instance; this
 * module-level table turns that pair back into the client-side callables the
 * kernel bound before the host was ever asked to start anything.
 *
 * The table is module state in the loader Worker's isolate — the same isolate
 * the client and the kernel run in — so an entry is reachable exactly while the
 * instance that owns it is running, and revocation is a delete.
