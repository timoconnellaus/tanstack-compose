# `@tanstack/compose-tools`

Plain composer tool definitions over a [`@tanstack/compose`](../compose)
**client**. This package does not contain an agent loop, session, prompt or
model integration; adapt the returned definitions to whichever agent runtime
you use.

```ts
import { createComposerTools } from '@tanstack/compose-tools'

const definitions = createComposerTools({
  client,
  catalog: { clock: clockPlugin },
  protected: ['policy'],
  stubs: [storageStub],
  host: 'cloudflare',
})

for (const definition of definitions) {
  agentTools.register({
    name: definition.name,
    description: definition.description,
    parameters: definition.parameters,
    validator: definition.validator,
    execute: definition.execute,
  })
}
```

The tools list, enable, disable, configure, add from the closed catalog, read,
write, rewrite and remove entries. Source is checked against exactly the grants
it will receive. `read_plugin` is required before `rewrite_plugin`, and the
rewrite is refused if the source changed after the read.

`composerPrompt(options)` returns the live explanatory prompt section an agent
runtime may mount beside the tools. `optionsSchema`, `jsonSchemaValidator`, and
`schemaOf` are exported for runtimes and catalog plugins that need to expose
the same option metadata.
